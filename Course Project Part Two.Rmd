## Statistical Inference: Course Project - Part Two

# The "ToothGrowth" Dataset Basic Inferential Analysis

Sagi Greenstine

## Overview

### The "ToothGrowth" Dataset

The ToothGrowth dataset in R this is a set of observations of the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs.

The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, (orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).

### The Course Project Report

This report is a basic inferential analysis of the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package. Firstly, I'll load the dataset and perform some basic exploratory analyses, it will also be presented a basic summary of the data. After that will be used confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. 

## Data Processing

### Loading and viewing the data

Loading the dataset:

```{r loaddata}
library(datasets)
if(!exists("tgdata")){
  tgdata <- ToothGrowth
}
```

```{r headdata}
head(tgdata)
```

The structure of the data:

```{r strdataset}
str(tgdata)
```

A data frame with 60 observations on 3 variables:

1. **len**      *numeric*       - Tooth length

2. **supp**     *factor*        - Supplement type (VC or OJ)

3. **dose**	    *numeric*       - Dose in milligrams/day

### The summary of the data

```{r summarydata}
summary(tgdata)
```

### Exploratory data analysis diagram

The ToothGrowth dataset plot (the dependence of tooth length on the dose of vitamin C for each supplement type):

```{r dataplot, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=ToothGrowth, aes(x=as.factor(dose), y=len)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    facet_grid(. ~ supp) +
    xlab("Dose(mg/day)") +
    ylab("Tooth Length") +
    ggtitle("ToothGrowth Data")        
```

Obviously, there is a clear positive correlation between the tooth lenght and the dose of vitamin C for two supplement types.

## Data Analysis

### Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests

1. Analysis of the data for correlation between the supplement type and the tooth length:

```{r supp}
t.test(len ~ supp, paired=F, var.equal=F, data=tgdata)
```

The confidence interval doesn't let to reject the null hypothesis of no correlation between the supplement type and the tooth length.

2. Analysis of the data for correlation between the dose and the tooth length:

```{r dose}
dose1 <- subset(tgdata, dose %in% c(0.5, 1.0))
dose2 <- subset(tgdata, dose %in% c(1.0, 2.0))
dose3 <- subset(tgdata, dose %in% c(0.5, 2.0))
t.test(len ~ dose, paired=F, var.equal=F, data=dose1)
t.test(len ~ dose, paired=F, var.equal=F, data=dose2)
t.test(len ~ dose, paired=F, var.equal=F, data=dose3)
```

The confidence intervals allow to reject the null hypothesis and confirm that there is a significant correlation between the dose and the tooth length.

3. Analysis of the data for correlation between the supplement type and tooth length for each dosage level:

```{r suppdose}
dose0.5 <- subset(tgdata, dose==0.5)
dose1.0 <- subset(tgdata, dose==1.0)
dose2.0 <- subset(tgdata, dose==2.0)
t.test(len ~ supp, paired=F, var.equal=F, data=dose0.5)
t.test(len ~ supp, paired=F, var.equal=F, data=dose1.0)
t.test(len ~ supp, paired=F, var.equal=F, data=dose2.0)
```

The confidence intervals for dosage levels of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/day allow to reject the null hypothesis and confirm that there is a significant correlation between the supplement type and tooth length for these dosage levels.

However, the confidence interval for dosage level of 2.0 mg/day doesn't allow to reject the null hypothesis.

## The conclusions and the assumptions

Here are some conclusions based on the above data analysis:

1. There is no correlation between the supplement type and the tooth length (cannot reject the null hypothesis).
2. There is a significant correlation between the dose and the tooth length (the null hypotesis is rejected).
3. There is a significant correlation between the supplement type and tooth length for 0.5 and 1.0 mg/day dosage levels (the null hypothesis is rejected).    However, for 2.0 mg/day dosage level there is no correlation between the supplement type and tooth length (cannot reject the null hypothesis).

The assumptions for these conclusions:

1. The given sample of guinea pigs is a representative for all the population of guinea pigs.
2. The dosage levels and the supplement types are randomly assigned.
3. The distribution of the values is normal.
