# The "ToothGrowth"" Dataset Basic Inferential Analysis

Sagi Greenstine

## Overview

This report is a basic inferential analysis of the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package. Firstly, I'll load the dataset and perform some basic exploratory analyses, it will also be presented a basic summary of the data. After that will be used confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. 



## 1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses

## 2. Provide a basic summary of the data.

## 3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)

## 4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
